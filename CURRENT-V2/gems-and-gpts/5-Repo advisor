### Phase 1: Repository Understanding & Initial Assessment
1.  **Clarify Your Goals & Scope:**
    *   "Hello! Please share the GitHub repository URL you'd like to work on."
    *   "What are your main goals for this session? For example, are you looking for a code review, ideas for new features, help understanding a specific module, or something else?"
    *   "Are there any particular parts of the repository or specific functionalities you'd like to focus on initially?"
2.  **Gathering Information (Interactive):**
    *   Since I can't directly browse the repository files like a human, I'll rely on you to provide information.
    *   "Could you start by describing the main purpose of this repository and its key features?"
    *   "What are the primary programming languages, frameworks, and any significant libraries or dependencies used in the project?"
    *   "Can you give me an overview of the project's directory structure? What are the roles of the main folders and any key configuration files?"
3.  **Summarize & Confirm My Understanding:**
    *   Based on your descriptions, I will summarize my understanding of the repository's purpose, core functionality, technology stack, and high-level architecture.
    *   "Does this initial understanding sound accurate? Is there anything important I've missed or perhaps misunderstood?"

### Phase 2: Code Review & Improvement Identification (If this is one of your goals)
1.  **Focus Areas for Review:**
    *   "Now that I have a better picture, are there specific modules, files, functions, or architectural aspects you'd like to review or get feedback on?"
    *   "What are your current thoughts or concerns regarding the existing codebase? This could relate to complexity, maintainability, performance, potential bugs, or adherence to best practices."
2.  **Guided Review & Collaborative Suggestions:**
    *   Together, we can explore aspects like:
        *   **Readability & Clarity:** Is the code self-explanatory? Are naming conventions clear and consistent? Is the logic easy to follow?
        *   **Modularity & Structure:** Is the code well-organized into logical units? Are concerns effectively separated? How does data flow between components?
        *   **Potential Issues & Risks:** Can we identify any potential logical flaws, areas prone to errors, inefficient patterns, or security considerations?
        *   **Best Practices & Patterns:** Does the code align with common best practices and relevant design patterns for the languages and frameworks in use?
        *   **Refactoring Opportunities:** Are there parts of the code that could be simplified, made more efficient, more reusable, or easier to test?
    *   I will ask targeted questions to help you analyze these aspects and will offer suggestions based on established software engineering principles.

### Phase 3: Feature Brainstorming & Functionality Expansion (If this is one of your goals)
1.  **Exploring New Possibilities:**
    *   "What new capabilities, enhancements, or solutions are *you* interested in adding to this project for your own use?"
    *   "What problems are *you* trying to solve for yourself, or what value are *you* aiming to get from these additions?"
    *   Let's brainstorm features. We can think about:
        *   Extending existing functionalities.
        *   Adding entirely new capabilities you'd find useful.
        *   Addressing any current limitations or frustrations *you* have with the repository.
2.  **Evaluating & Prioritizing Ideas:**
    *   For each potential idea, we can discuss:
        *   How valuable or interesting *you* find this feature.
        *   A high-level assessment of its technical complexity.
        *   **Estimated difficulty for AI coders to implement:** Would this likely require straightforward coding, or does it involve complex logic, many integrations, or novel algorithms that might be challenging for an AI?
        *   Any dependencies or prerequisites.
        *   "Based on this, which ideas are you most excited to move forward with, and in what general order, considering both your interest and AI implementation feasibility?"
    *   "If you're looking to formalize the initial idea, you could consider using the `project-brief.txt` template structure to capture these high-level thoughts before we dive into detailed Epics."

### Phase 4: Structuring Enhancements into Epics and Stories
1.  **Define Epics from Prioritized Ideas:**
    *   "For each prioritized feature/enhancement, let's guide *you* to define it as an Epic. An Epic represents a significant piece of functionality. *You can use the structure from your `epicN.txt` template as a guide when defining these.*"
    *   "For Epic [Feature Name]: What is the overall goal of this Epic from your perspective?"
    *   "What are the main benefits *you* will get once this Epic is completed?"
    *   "If the Epic is complex, *you might consider* outlining a brief overview. The `prd.txt` template (specifically its 'Epic Overview' section) could serve as a model. For architectural considerations, the `architecture-templates.txt` could offer inspiration if detailed technical planning is needed at this stage."
2.  **Break Down Epics into User Stories:**
    *   "Now, let's guide *you* to break down each Epic into smaller, manageable User Stories. A User Story should describe a small piece of functionality from your perspective as the user. *You should aim to follow the format in your `story-template.txt` when detailing these.*"
    *   "For Epic [Feature Name], what are the specific actions *you* will be able to perform, or what specific outcomes will *you* see?"
    *   "For each User Story (e.g., 'As the user, I want to X so that Y'), *you will want to define*:
        *   **Title:** A concise name for the story.
        *   **User Story:** The "As a user, I want..., so that..." statement.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):** A list of conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete. These should be clear, testable, and specific enough for an AI coder to understand the expected outcome. Example: 'Given [context], when I [action], then I [result].'
        *   **Technical Notes for AI Coder (Optional but helpful):** Any specific files to modify, functions to create, APIs to call, or particular logic considerations that would help an AI coder implement this story. *Highlight anything that reduces ambiguity.*
        *   If UI/UX is involved for a story, *you can note* elements that might be detailed in a `ui-ux-spec.txt` style document, using your template as a reference for structure if needed."
3.  **Review and Refine Epics & Stories:**
    *   "Let's review the drafted Epics and Stories. During this review, *you might find it helpful to mentally refer to* the principles in your checklists:
        *   `pm-checklist.txt` can guide thinking about overall scope and requirements.
        *   `story-draft-checklist.txt` is excellent for ensuring stories are complete enough for an AI to implement.
        *   `po-checklist.txt` can help in thinking about logical sequencing and core value (akin to MVP thinking).
        This can help ensure quality and clarity."
    *   "Are the User Stories small enough to be implemented relatively independently?"
    *   "Are the Acceptance Criteria clear and unambiguous for an AI coder?"
    *   "Is there enough technical guidance (where needed) to point an AI coder in the right direction?"
    *   "Does the collection of stories for an Epic fully cover its intended scope?"
    *   "Considering the AI implementation aspect, are there any stories that seem particularly complex or risky? *You should consider if they need to be broken down further or if more specific technical notes are needed*. The `architect-checklist.txt` can provide good inspiration for the types of technical considerations to include, especially for complex stories."

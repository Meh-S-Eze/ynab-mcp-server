# .mdc Rule Formatting Guidelines

- **Root-Relative Globs:**
  - Never use `**/*` as a glob patternâ€”it matches every file in the workspace, including config and documentation, which can cause unintended effects.
  - Use `newprojectfolder/**` (replace with your actual project folder name) for rules that should only apply to files in a specific project or subfolder.
  - For language-specific rules, use patterns like `newprojectfolder/**/*.py`.
  - Do not use ambiguous or context-dependent globs.
- **Agent-Generated Rule Descriptions:**
  - If a rule is created by an agent, the `description` field must specify which root directory the rule is intended for (e.g., "This rule is for the project root").
- **Glob Transparency:**
  - The body of every rule must include a section listing the current `globs:` patterns being used for that rule, for clarity and transparency.
- **Rule Body (Markdown format, after the frontmatter):**
  - Start with a `#` heading for the rule title.
  - Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.
  - Provide clear, concise instructions or conventions.
  - Reference files or examples using `@filename` if needed.
  - Keep content focused and actionable.
  - Include a section like:
    ```markdown
    **Current globs for this rule:**
    - Never use this pattern **/*  
    - newprojectfolder/**  always use this pattern with  <!-- Applies only to files in 'newprojectfolder' subfolder -->
    ```

**Example:**

# Example Rule Title

**Current globs for this rule:**
- newprojectfolder/**   <!-- Applies only to files in 'newprojectfolder' subfolder -->

- **Main Points in Bold**
  - Sub-points with details
  - Examples and explanations

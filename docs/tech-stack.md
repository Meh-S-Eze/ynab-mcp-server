ynab-mcp-server API Enhancement Technology Stack
This document outlines the key technologies and libraries used in the ynab-mcp-server API Enhancement project.

Category	Technology	Version (from package.json or inferred)	Description / Purpose	Justification
Languages	TypeScript	^5.3.3	Primary language for the server and tools.	Existing project language; strong typing, modern JavaScript features.
Runtime	Node.js	>=20.0.0 (implied by mcp-framework)	Server-side JavaScript execution environment.	Required by mcp-framework and common for TypeScript projects.
Frameworks	mcp-framework	^0.1.29	Core framework for building MCP servers and tools.	Existing project framework; simplifies MCP implementation.
YNAB Interaction	ynab (Official YNAB SDK)	^2.9.0	Library for interacting with the YNAB API.	Official SDK; provides convenient API access.
Schema/Validation	zod	^3.23.8 (from mcp-framework peer or direct)	Schema declaration and validation library.	Existing project choice; powerful and type-safe validation.
Testing	vitest	^1.4.0	Test runner and framework.	Existing project choice (vitest.config.ts present).
@vitest/coverage-v8	^1.4.0	Coverage reporting for vitest.	Existing project choice.
Build Tools	typescript (tsc)	^5.3.3	TypeScript compiler.	Standard for TypeScript projects.
mcp-build (from mcp-framework)	^0.1.29 (inferred)	Builds/packages the MCP server.	Part of mcp-framework.
Utilities	axios	^1.8.4	HTTP client (dependency of ynab or direct use).	Commonly used for HTTP requests if needed beyond SDK.
Dev Dependencies	@types/node	^20.11.24	Type definitions for Node.js.	Essential for TypeScript development with Node.js.
@types/axios	^0.14.4	Type definitions for Axios.	Provides type safety for Axios.

## Additional Notes from Architecture Part 3

Exact Node.js version should be consistent across development and deployment environments. The mcp-framework specifies >=20.0.0.
The versions listed are based on the package.json provided (dated May 2025 for this generation). Ensure these are kept up-to-date with security patches and desired features.

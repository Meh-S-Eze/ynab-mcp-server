**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As the primary user and developer, I want the new bulk transaction tools (`create_bulk_transactions`, `update_bulk_transactions`) to be clearly documented in `README.md` so I can efficiently manage multiple transactions.

**Context:** This Epic 4 story documents the bulk transaction tools from Epic 3.

## Detailed Requirements

For each tool from Epic 3 (`create_bulk_transactions`, `update_bulk_transactions`):
- Add a section to `README.md` (likely under "Transaction Tools" or a new "Bulk Transaction Tools" subsection).
- Include name, description.
- Detail the structure of the required `transactions` array parameter, showing the expected object structure for each item in the array (noting amounts in currency units, and no subtransactions per item for bulk).
- For `update_bulk_transactions`, specify that each object in the array needs an `id`.
- Provide example MCP command demonstrating the array input.
- Describe the expected bulk API response output (e.g., `bulk` object with `transaction_ids`).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: `README.md` documents `create_bulk_transactions` with details on the `transactions` array structure (each item like `SaveTransaction` but no subtransactions, amounts in currency) and example.
- AC2: `README.md` documents `update_bulk_transactions` with details on the `transactions` array structure (each item needing `id` and other updatable fields, no subtransactions, amounts in currency) and example.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation.
- **Relevant Files:** `README.md`
- **Key Technologies:** Markdown
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:** N/A. Refer to Epic 3 implementations (Stories 3.1, 3.2).
- **Coding Standards Notes:** Consistent Markdown. Clearly show array structure in examples.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update `README.md`:
  - [ ] Add section for `create_bulk_transactions`:
    - [ ] Name, Description.
    - [ ] Parameter: `transactions` (required array of transaction objects; detail structure - `accountId`, `date`, `amount` in currency, etc., no subtransactions per item).
    - [ ] Example showing array input.
    - [ ] Output: (e.g. `response.data.bulk` object).
  - [ ] Add section for `update_bulk_transactions`:
    - [ ] Name, Description.
    - [ ] Parameter: `transactions` (required array of transaction objects; detail structure - required `id`, other updatable fields, no subtransactions per item, amounts in currency).
    - [ ] Example showing array input.
    - [ ] Output: (e.g. `response.data.bulk` object).
- [ ] Verify accuracy with Epic 3 implementations.

## Testing Requirements

- **Manual/CLI Verification:** Review `README.md` for clarity and accuracy of the bulk operations, especially the `transactions` array structure and constraints.

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As the primary user and developer, I want the "Available tools" section of the `README.md` to be well-organized and easy to navigate after adding documentation for all the new and enhanced tools.

**Context:** This final story in Epic 4 is about ensuring the overall `README.md` remains coherent and user-friendly after all new tool documentation has been added.

## Detailed Requirements

- Review the entire "Available tools" section in `README.md`.
- Ensure a consistent formatting style is applied to all tool descriptions (new and old).
- Consider grouping tools logically (e.g., Category Tools, Transaction Tools (Single), Transaction Tools (Bulk)) if the list becomes long, to improve readability. This might involve creating subheadings.
- Update any general introductory text in the `README.md` (e.g., in "Goal" or "Workflows" or "Current state") if necessary to reflect the expanded capabilities of the server.
- Ensure all example prompts or use cases mentioned in the "Workflows" or "Current state" sections are updated if new tools supersede or enhance those examples (e.g., `update_transaction` might affect "updateCategory tool" or "updateTransaction more general tool" in "Next" items).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The "Available tools" section in `README.md` is consistently formatted.
- AC2: Tools are logically grouped with clear subheadings if beneficial for readability.
- AC3: Any introductory text or general examples in the `README.md` reflect the server's new capabilities and correctly reference the new/updated tools.
- AC4: "Next" items in `README.md` are updated if addressed by these epics (e.g., "approve multiple transactions", "updateCategory", "updateTransaction").

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation.
- **Relevant Files:** `README.md`
- **Key Technologies:** Markdown
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:** N/A.
- **Coding Standards Notes:** Focus on clarity, consistency, and navigability of the documentation.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Review and refactor the "Available tools" section in `README.md`:
  - [ ] Create logical groupings/subheadings (e.g., "Category Tools", "Single Transaction Tools", "Bulk Transaction Tools").
  - [ ] Ensure consistent formatting (name, description, params, example, output) for all tool entries (new and existing like `ListBudgets`, `BudgetSummary`, `GetUnapprovedTransactions`, `CreateTransaction`, `ApproveTransaction`).
- [ ] Update general `README.md` sections:
  - [ ] Review and update the "Goal" section if needed.
  - [ ] Review and update the "Workflows" section to incorporate new tool capabilities or provide better examples.
  - [ ] Review and update the "Current state" section (description of available tools) to be a brief overview, pointing to the detailed "Available tools" list.
  - [ ] Review and update the "Next" items list:
    - [ ] Mark "be able to approve multiple transactions with 1 call" as addressed (by `update_bulk_transactions`).
    - [ ] Mark "updateCategory tool" as addressed (by `update_category`).
    - [ ] Mark "updateTransaction more general tool" as addressed (by `update_transaction`).
- [ ] Perform a final read-through of the entire `README.md` for coherence and accuracy.

## Testing Requirements

- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Thoroughly review the entire `README.md` file.
  - Check for broken links or formatting issues.
  - Ensure the structure is logical and easy to follow.
  - Confirm that all new tools are documented and existing tool documentation is consistent.
  - Verify that introductory sections and "Next" items accurately reflect the project's new state.

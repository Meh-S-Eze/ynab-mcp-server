**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a YNAB user, I want an MCP tool to retrieve the complete details for a single specific transaction by its ID, so I can inspect all its attributes, including subtransactions.

**Context:** This story in Epic 2 adds the capability to fetch a single transaction by its ID, complementing the listing functionality from Story 2.1.

## Detailed Requirements

Implement a new MCP tool named `get_transaction_by_id`.
This tool maps to `GET /budgets/{budget_id}/transactions/{transaction_id}`.
Required parameter: `transaction_id` (string).
Optional parameter: `budget_id` (string) - defaults to `YNAB_BUDGET_ID`.
The tool should output the full `TransactionDetail` object, including subtransactions.
Amounts for the main transaction and its subtransactions must be converted from milliunits to currency strings.
Implement in `src/tools/GetTransactionByIdTool.ts`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Executing `get_transaction_by_id transaction_id=<id>` (with `budget_id` context) returns full details of the specified transaction, amounts converted.
- AC2: If the transaction has subtransactions, they are included and their amounts are correctly converted.
- AC3: Error handling for invalid IDs or API errors is in place.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation.
- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `src/tools/GetTransactionByIdTool.ts`
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`)_

- **Key Technologies:**
  - TypeScript, Node.js, `mcp-framework`, `ynab` SDK, `zod`.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Use `this.api.transactions.getTransactionById(budgetId, transaction_id)`.
  - Response data in `response.data.transaction`.
  - Convert `transaction.amount` and `transaction.subtransactions[].amount` from milliunits to currency strings.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

- **Data Structures:**
  - Input schema with `zod`: `budgetId` (opt), `transaction_id` (req).
  - Output: A single transformed `ynab.TransactionDetail` object.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`)_

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `YNAB_API_TOKEN`, `YNAB_BUDGET_ID`.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Tool name: `get_transaction_by_id`. Filename: `GetTransactionByIdTool.ts`.
  - Error handling and logging.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create `src/tools/GetTransactionByIdTool.ts`.
- [ ] Define `name` ("get_transaction_by_id") and `description`.
- [ ] Implement constructor.
- [ ] Define `schema` for `budgetId` (optional) and `transaction_id` (required).
- [ ] Implement `execute` method:
  - [ ] Determine `budgetId`. Handle missing IDs.
  - [ ] Call `this.api.transactions.getTransactionById(budgetId, input.transaction_id)`.
  - [ ] Handle API errors (AC3).
  - [ ] Transform the response, paying attention to `transaction.amount` and `transaction.subtransactions[].amount` for currency conversion.
  - [ ] Return the transformed transaction object.
  - [ ] Add logging.

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create `src/tools/GetTransactionByIdTool.test.ts`.
  - Mock `ynab.API` and `transactions.getTransactionById`.
  - Test successful retrieval and transformation, including subtransactions.
  - Test parameter handling and error states.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Test against a live YNAB transaction, including one with splits.
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)_

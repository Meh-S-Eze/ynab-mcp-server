**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As the primary user and developer, I want the significantly enhanced `create_transaction` tool and the new `update_transaction` and `delete_transaction` tools to be thoroughly documented in `README.md`.

**Context:** This Epic 4 story ensures documentation for the critical transaction write operations from Epic 2.

## Detailed Requirements

- For the enhanced `create_transaction` tool (from Story 2.3):
  - Update its existing documentation in `README.md` to reflect full parameter support, especially the addition of `import_id` and `subtransactions` (with structure of subtransaction objects and note that amounts are in currency units).
  - Provide clear examples for creating simple and split/sub-transactions.
- For the new `update_transaction` tool (from Story 2.4):
  - Add a section to `README.md` including its name, description, all parameters (`transaction_id` and all updatable fields from `SaveTransaction`, noting amounts are in currency units), and example usage.
- For the new `delete_transaction` tool (from Story 2.5):
  - Add a section to `README.md` including its name, description, parameters, and example.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: `README.md` documentation for `create_transaction` is updated to include all new parameters (especially `import_id`, `subtransactions` with their structure and currency unit amounts) with examples for simple and split transactions.
- AC2: `README.md` contains comprehensive documentation for the new `update_transaction` tool, including all its optional parameters for updating.
- AC3: `README.md` contains documentation for the new `delete_transaction` tool.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation.
- **Relevant Files:** `README.md`
- **Key Technologies:** Markdown
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:** N/A. Refer to Epic 2 implementations (Stories 2.3, 2.4, 2.5).
- **Coding Standards Notes:** Consistent Markdown. Pay attention to example clarity for `subtransactions`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update `README.md` documentation for `create_transaction`:
  - [ ] Detail new optional parameters: `import_id`, `subtransactions` (array of objects: `amount` in currency, `payeeId`, `payeeName`, `categoryId`, `memo`).
  - [ ] Add example for simple transaction with `import_id`.
  - [ ] Add example for split transaction using `subtransactions`.
- [ ] Add `README.md` section for `update_transaction`:
  - [ ] Name, Description.
  - [ ] Parameters: `transaction_id` (req), `budgetId` (opt), and all other optional fields from `SaveTransaction` for update (including `subtransactions`, noting amounts in currency units).
  - [ ] Example.
- [ ] Add `README.md` section for `delete_transaction`:
  - [ ] Name, Description.
  - [ ] Parameters: `transaction_id` (req), `budgetId` (opt).
  - [ ] Example.
- [ ] Verify accuracy with Epic 2 implementations.

## Testing Requirements

- **Manual/CLI Verification:** Review `README.md` for clarity, accuracy, especially the `subtransaction` examples and parameter lists.

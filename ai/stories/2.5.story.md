**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a YNAB user, I want an MCP tool to delete a specific transaction by its ID, so I can remove erroneous or unwanted entries programmatically.

**Context:** This story in Epic 2 introduces the capability to delete transactions, completing the basic CRUD operations for single transactions.

## Detailed Requirements

Implement a new MCP tool named `delete_transaction`.
This tool maps to `DELETE /budgets/{budget_id}/transactions/{transaction_id}`.
Required parameter: `transaction_id` (string).
Optional parameter: `budget_id` (string).
The tool should confirm successful deletion and output the details of the deleted transaction (as returned by the YNAB API).
Amounts in the output (if any on the returned deleted transaction object) should be converted to currency strings.
Implement in `src/tools/DeleteTransactionTool.ts`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Executing `delete_transaction transaction_id=<id>` (with `budget_id` context) successfully deletes the transaction.
- AC2: The tool returns the `TransactionDetail` of the deleted transaction from the API response, with amounts converted.
- AC3: Appropriate error handling for invalid IDs or API issues.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation.
- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `src/tools/DeleteTransactionTool.ts`
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`)_

- **Key Technologies:**
  - TypeScript, Node.js, `mcp-framework`, `ynab` SDK, `zod`.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md`)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Use `this.api.transactions.deleteTransaction(budgetId, transaction_id)`.
  - Response data in `response.data.transaction` contains the details of the deleted transaction.
  - Convert amounts in this output object to currency strings.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/api-reference.md`)_

- **Data Structures:**
  - Input Zod schema: `budgetId` (opt), `transaction_id` (req).
  - Output: A transformed `ynab.TransactionDetail` object representing the deleted transaction.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md`)_

- **Environment Variables:**
  - `YNAB_API_TOKEN`, `YNAB_BUDGET_ID`.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md`)_

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Tool name: `delete_transaction`. Filename: `DeleteTransactionTool.ts`.
  - Error handling and logging.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create `src/tools/DeleteTransactionTool.ts`.
- [ ] Define `name` ("delete_transaction") and `description`.
- [ ] Implement constructor.
- [ ] Define `schema` for `budgetId` (optional) and `transaction_id` (required).
- [ ] Implement `execute` method:
  - [ ] Determine `budgetId`. Handle missing `transaction_id`.
  - [ ] Call `this.api.transactions.deleteTransaction(budgetId, input.transaction_id)`.
  - [ ] Handle API errors (AC3).
  - [ ] Transform `response.data.transaction` (convert amounts).
  - [ ] Return the transformed deleted transaction object.
  - [ ] Add logging.

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Create `src/tools/DeleteTransactionTool.test.ts`.
  - Mock `ynab.API` and `transactions.deleteTransaction`.
  - Test successful deletion and the structure/transformation of the returned object.
  - Test error states (e.g., transaction not found).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Test deleting a live YNAB transaction. Verify its deletion in YNAB UI.
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`)_
